# Bug Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified
1. Collector pickup and active pickup sections were showing errors
2. Missing user information (name and email) in pickup data
3. Incorrect middleware order in Express server causing 404 errors
4. Missing TypeScript interface updates

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Database Query Updates
Modified the pickup model functions in `backend/src/models/pickup.model.ts` to include user information in the returned data:

- Updated `getPickupsByCollectorId` to join users table and include user_name and user_email
- Updated `getPickupById` to join users table and include user_name and user_email
- Updated `getPendingPickups` to join users table and include user_name and user_email
- Updated `getPickupsByUserId` to join users table and include user_name and user_email

### 2. TypeScript Interface Updates
Updated the Pickup interface in `backend/src/models/Pickup.ts` to include optional user_name and user_email fields:

```typescript
export interface Pickup {
  // ... existing fields ...
  user_name?: string;
  user_email?: string;
}
```

### 3. Server Middleware Order Fix
Moved the 404 handler middleware to the end of the middleware stack in `backend/src/server.ts` to ensure routes are properly matched before returning 404 errors.

### 4. Build and Test
- Rebuilt the backend project to resolve TypeScript errors
- Created sample data for testing
- Verified API endpoints are working correctly with proper data structure

## Testing Results
API tests confirm that:
- Collector pickups endpoint returns pickup data with user information
- Specific pickup details endpoint returns pickup data with user information
- All status updates work correctly
- User authentication and authorization function properly

## Pages Affected
The following collector pages now work correctly with dynamic data:
- CollectorActivePickups.tsx
- CollectorPickupDetails.tsx
- CollectorRequests.tsx

All data is now properly fetched from the database and displayed dynamically in the UI.
